### ★语法解释

一些形容词与某些介词搭配使用。没有关于哪个介词与哪个形容词搭配使用的语法规则，因此尝试一起学习它们是个好主意。为了帮助您做到这一点，请在笔记本中以句子或短语的形式写下新词汇。

但是，有一些模式可以帮助您。让我们先看看它们。请记住，介词后面跟着名词或动名词（-ing 形式）。

1.  与 at 搭配\
    我们将 at 与形容词（如_good_好/_bad_坏/_amazing_惊人/_brilliant_出色/_terrible_糟糕等）搭配使用，以谈论技能和能力。

    > _He's really **good at** English._\
    > _She's **amazing at** the piano._\
    > _They're **terrible at** organising anything._\
    > _I'm not very **good at** drawing._


2.  与 about 搭配\
    我们经常将 about 与表示情绪的形容词（如_angry_生气/_excited_兴奋/_happy_快乐/_nervous_紧张/_sad_悲伤/_stressed_有压力/_worried_担心等）搭配使用，以解释是什么导致了这种情绪。

    > _I'm **angry about** the decision._\
    > _He's **nervous about** the presentation._\
    > _She's **excited about** the new job._\
    > _They were **worried about** the exam._


3.  与 of 搭配\
    但是，有时我们会用 of 来表达感受。

    > _She was **afraid of** telling her mum._\
    > _I'm **frightened of** having an accident._\
    > _He's **scared of** flying._\
    > _You should be **proud of** your progress._


4.  与 to 搭配 \
    我们可以使用 to 来显示人或事物之间的联系。&#x20;

    > _He's **married to** the director._\
    > _I'm **addicted to** my phone._\
    > _I'm **allergic to** nuts._\
    > _It's **similar to** the old one._

    \
    我们还可以使用 to 来谈论某人对其他人的行为。&#x20;

    > _They were really **friendly to** me._\
    > _Was he **nice to** you?_\
    > _He is always **polite to** everyone._\
    > _She was very **rude to** the waitress._



以下是其他一些有用的带介词的形容词。

1.  与 for 搭配

    > _Exercise is **good for** you._\
    > _Stress is **bad for** you._\
    > _The town is **famous for** its cheese._\
    > _I'm **responsible for** the financial side of the business._


2.  与 in 搭配

    > _She's **interested in** the project._\
    > _They want someone who's **experienced in** design._\
    > _I didn't want to get **involved in** the argument._
