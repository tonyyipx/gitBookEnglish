Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.

**Georgie**\
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Georgie, and we're ready to start, Phil… Phil?!&#x20;

**Phil**\
Oh, sorry, Georgie, I was er, just, **catching forty winks**… you know, **getting** **some shut-eye, dozing, taking a nap**... I was sleeping!

**Georgie**\
Sleeping at work! Phil, how could you?

**Phil**\
I know, I know. Sorry, I… I didn’t sleep well last night.

**Georgie**\
I'll forgive you this time, but make sure you go to bed early tonight because getting a good night's sleep is incredibly important. For example, did you know that people who get enough sleep live about five years longer than people who don't?

**Phil**\
Wow, so a good night's sleep can lengthen your life. In this programme, we'll be finding out more about the benefits of sleep, and, as usual, learning some useful new vocabulary as well.&#x20;

**Georgie**\
But first, now that you've woken up, I have a question for you. Do you know how much of the average person's life is spent asleep? Is it:

a)    a half?\
b)    a quarter? or,\
c)    a third?

**Phil**\
Hmm, I think we spend about a third of our lives sleeping.

**Georgie**\
OK, well I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme. The question of why humans sleep is not easy to answer. In terms of evolution, why would it make sense to go unconscious every night, leaving yourself vulnerable to danger? It can only mean that the benefits gained from sleep are huge. Here, science journalist, Ginny Smith, explains some of these benefits to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Science:

**Ginny Smith**\
So we've probably all experienced this, that if you've had a bad night sleep and then you try and do some work you just can't concentrate - your brain isn't in the right state to **take in** new information. But we also need to sleep after we've learnt new things because that's when our brain consolidates the information - takes it from short-term storage to long-term storage, fits it in with other things we already know, that old adage of if you've got a problem **sleep on it**, your brain does actually work on things during the night, and you can often wake up and have solved the problem in your sleep.

**Phil**\
When we sleep, our brains refresh, leaving us feeling rested in the morning. But after a bad night's sleep it's more difficult to concentrate. We can’t **take in**, or understand, new information.

**Georgie**\
We also have the saying, if you've got a problem, **sleep on it**. To **sleep on it** means to delay making a decision until you've had time to think about it. But that also turns out to be true scientifically speaking - during sleep, your brain really can work out problems and find solutions.

**Phil**\
But what about the other side of the story? What happens when you get too little sleep, or none at all? Here's Ginny Smith again, talking to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Science:

**Ginny Smith**\
Sleep **deprivation** is a form of stress, and we know that when you are stressed your sort of **fight-or-flight response** is activated and that causes all these changes in your body that focus on immediate survival over long-term health. But if we are chronically stressed - money worries, or a stressful job, or something that's going on forever, or life, or chronic sleep deprivation that's causing that level of stress, then you might constantly have a damped down immune system which can then lead to all these **knock-on** problems.&#x20;

**Georgie**\
Having none or too little of something important is known as **deprivation**. Sleep deprivation is stressful for the body – so stressful that it activates a **fight-or-flight response**, changes in the human body in response to a life-threatening situation which make us either stay and fight the threat or run away from it.

**Phil**\
As well as a **fight-or-flight response**, the stress of not getting enough sleep over a longer period also creates problems including heart disease and a weakened immune system. Lack of sleep has these **knock-on effects**, it causes other things to happen, but not directly.

**Georgie**\
Now do you see why it's so important to get a good night's sleep, Phil? Plus, it will stop you sleeping at work again! Right, I think it's time to reveal the answer to my question.

**Phil**\
Yes, you asked me how much of the average person's life is spent asleep, and I said it was about a third.

**Georgie**\
Which was… the correct answer! Assuming you sleep eight hours a day, the average person will sleep for 229,961 hours in their lifetime or around one third of their life. OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with the phrases **catch forty winks, get some shut-eye, doze** and **take a nap**, all of which mean to sleep.

**Phil**\
When someone **takes in** information, they understand it.     &#x20;

**Georgie**\
If you have a problem and you **sleep on it,** you delay making a decision until you’ve had time to think about it.

**Phil**\
**Deprivation** is an absence or too little of something important such as food or sleep.&#x20;

**Georgie**\
The **fight-or-flight response** describes changes in the human body in response to a dangerous situation which make us either stay and fight the threat or run away from it.

**Phil**\
And finally, if something has a **knock-on effect**,itcauses other results indirectly. Once again our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!

**Georgie**\
Bye!

<summary>cn: TRANSCRIPT</summary>

请注意：这不是逐字逐句的翻译。

**乔琪** 大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 学英语的《6 分钟英语》。我是乔琪，准备开始了，菲尔……菲尔？！

**菲尔** 哦，对不起，乔琪，我刚才……在打个盹儿……你知道的，小睡片刻、打个瞌睡……我是在睡觉！

**乔琪** 在工作时间睡觉！菲尔，你怎么可以这样？

**菲尔** 我知道，我知道。抱歉，昨晚我没睡好。

**乔琪** 这次我就原谅你了，但今晚记得早点睡觉，因为好的睡眠非常重要。比如，你知道吗，睡眠充足的人比睡眠不足的人平均多活五年呢？

**菲尔** 哇，好的睡眠竟然能延长寿命。在本期节目中，我们会进一步了解睡眠的好处，并且像往常一样，学到一些实用的新词汇。

**乔琪** 但是首先，既然你已经醒了，我有个问题要问你。你知道平均一个人一生中有多少时间在睡觉吗？是： a) 一半？ b) 四分之一？还是， c) 三分之一？

**菲尔** 嗯，我认为我们一生大约有三分之一的时间在睡觉。

**乔琪** 好的，我会在节目最后揭晓正确答案。关于人类为什么要睡觉，这个问题并不容易回答。从进化角度来看，为什么每晚要失去意识，让自己处于危险之中呢？这只能说明，睡眠带来的好处是巨大的。以下是科学记者金妮·史密斯在 BBC Radio 4 节目《科学内幕》中解释的一些好处：

**金妮·史密斯** 我们可能都经历过，如果晚上没睡好，第二天工作时就很难集中注意力——大脑无法处于正确的状态来接受新信息。但我们在学习新东西后也需要睡觉，因为这时大脑会巩固这些信息——从短期记忆转移到长期记忆，与我们已经知道的其他信息整合在一起。所谓“有问题就睡一觉再说”，这是真的。晚上大脑确实会处理一些事情，很多时候你醒来时问题已经解决了。

**菲尔** 当我们睡觉时，大脑会得到恢复，让我们早晨感到精神焕发。但如果前一晚没睡好，就很难集中注意力，无法接受或理解新的信息。

**乔琪** 我们也有一句谚语：“有问题就睡一觉再说”。意思是先延迟决策，等有时间思考后再做决定。而科学上也证明了这一点——睡觉时，大脑真的可以处理问题并找到解决方案。

**菲尔** 那另一面呢？如果我们睡眠不足甚至完全不睡会发生什么？这是金妮·史密斯再次在 BBC Radio 4 节目《科学内幕》中的解释：

**金妮·史密斯** 睡眠剥夺是一种压力反应，我们知道，当你处于压力状态时，会激活“战斗或逃跑”反应，这会在你的身体中引发一系列变化，优先考虑短期生存而不是长期健康。但如果我们长期处于压力状态，比如金钱问题、工作压力或持续不断的生活问题，或者慢性睡眠不足导致的压力，那么你的免疫系统可能会持续受到抑制，这就会导致各种后续健康问题。

**乔琪** 缺少或没有足够的重要东西称为剥夺。睡眠剥夺对身体来说是一种压力——压力大到会激活“战斗或逃跑”反应，这种反应是在面临生命威胁时身体发生的变化，让我们要么面对威胁，要么逃离。

**菲尔** 除了“战斗或逃跑”反应，长期睡眠不足带来的压力还会导致心脏病和免疫系统减弱。缺乏睡眠有这些连锁反应，它会间接引发其他问题。

**乔琪** 现在你知道为什么保持良好的睡眠如此重要了吧，菲尔？而且，这样你就不会再在工作时打瞌睡了！好了，现在是揭晓我问题答案的时候了。

**菲尔** 是的，你问我平均一个人一生中有多少时间在睡觉，我说大约是三分之一。

**乔琪** 没错！如果你每天睡八个小时，平均一个人一生中会睡 229,961 小时，差不多占一生的三分之一。好了，让我们回顾一下今天学到的词汇，首先是 catch forty winks（打个盹）、get some shut-eye（打瞌睡）、doze（打瞌睡）和 take a nap（小睡），这些都表示睡觉。

**菲尔** 当某人吸收信息时，意味着他们理解了这些信息。

**乔琪** 如果你有问题并决定 sleep on it（睡一觉再说），意思是你延迟决策，等你有时间思考后再做决定。

**菲尔** 剥夺（deprivation）是指缺乏或没有足够的重要东西，比如食物或睡眠。

**乔琪** 战斗或逃跑反应（fight-or-flight response）描述的是人在面对危险情况时，身体发生的变化，让我们要么战斗，要么逃跑。

**菲尔** 最后，如果某事有连锁反应（knock-on effect），意味着它会间接引发其他结果。我们六分钟的时间又到了，但记得下次再来收听更多热门话题和实用词汇，尽在《6 分钟英语》。再见！

**乔琪** 再见！
