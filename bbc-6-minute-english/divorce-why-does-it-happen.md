**Phil**\
Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.

**Georgie**\
And I’m Georgie.

**Phil**\
In the words of a famous 1960s pop song, ‘breaking up is hard to do’. Divorce, when a married couple who no longer want to be together separate, can be one of life’s toughest experiences.

**Georgie**\
During the 1990s, divorce rates in Europe and America were the highest in the world, with almost half of all marriages ending in divorce. But since then, the trend has reversed and divorce rates in the West have slowed. Meanwhile, however, the number of couples divorcing in other parts of the world is on the rise.

**Phil**\
In this programme we’ll be hearing how divorce is talked about in different countries. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary. But first, I have a question for you, Georgie. In Britain, one day of the year in particular is known by divorce lawyers and relationship counsellors as ‘Divorce Day’, but which day is it?

a)    Christmas Day?\
b)    the first Monday of the new year? or,\
c)    Midsummer’s Day, the 24th of June?

**Georgie**\
Hmm, I think ‘Divorce Day’ is the first Monday of the year.

**Phil**\
OK, Georgie. We’ll find out if that’s the correct answer later in the programme. Getting married very young, and differences between partners’ backgrounds or interests are two common causes for couples to grow apart. Today, Marina Adshade is a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies the economics of sex and relationships, but her life has a very different beginning, as she told BBC World Service programme, The Global Story:

**Marina Adshade**\
I married really young, I had no education, I married somebody who is older than me, who had a lot of education and our relationship worked well for a while. And then in my late 20s I decided to go back to school, I no longer wanted to be a **stay-at-home mother** which was what I was doing in my 20s, and that change in our situation for us just became completely **unresolvable**. And I think this is true for a lot of marriages because people’s situation changes over their lives, maybe they want children then maybe they **change their minds**.

**Georgie**\
Marina started her married life as a **stay-at-home mum** – a woman who stays home to take care of the children and manage the household.

**Phil**\
Marina married an older man, and although their relationship started well, over time they developed different ideas about what they wanted from life. Marina and her husband **changed their minds** - they changed an earlier decision they had made.

**Georgie**\
Growing apart is one of the most frequently given reasons for divorce, and eventually Marina and her husband’s problems became **unresolvable** – not able to be fixed or satisfactorily ended. Marina’s experience is typical of someone who finds themself trapped in a marriage that no longer works. Yet unfortunately, due to economic or emotional reasons, many people stay trapped.

**Phil**\
So, what can be done? Now, some countries are looking to the authorities, rather than the couple themselves, for a solution. Here, Lucy Hockings, presenter of BBC World Service’s The Global Story and divorce counsellor, Joanna Gosling, discuss a new strategy being used in China:

**Lucy Hockings**\
There was an interesting thing they did in China where they introduced this **cooling-off period**. So, the government enforced this. Does that work when the government **intervenes** in a situation like this and makes people behave or do things in a certain way?

**Joanna Gosling**\
If nothing changes in the dynamic between two people, being told that they've got to cool off and wait a bit longer, I don't think is going to make them suddenly realise that they want to be together. It might be an idea for states to invest in communication programmes for these couples ‘cause that's **invariably** why relationships fall apart.

**Georgie**\
In response to rising divorce rates, in 2021 the Chinese government introduced a 30-day **cooling-off period** for couples wanting to separate. A **cooling-off period** is a period of time in which two groups who are arguing can try to improve the situation before taking further action. However, it’s unusual for governments to **intervene** - to become involved - in people’s private lives this way.&#x20;

**Phil**\
Joanna doubts a **cooling-off period** will work, especially as the main reason for relationships failing is non-communication. She says a lack of communication is **invariably** - or always - the reason for divorce. On the plus side, by communicating openly, maybe with the professional help of a relationship counsellor, saving a marriage is possible.

**Georgie**\
I think it’s time you reveal the answer to your question, Phil. You asked about ‘Divorce Day’ in Britain, and I guessed it was the first Monday of the new year.

**Phil**\
Good guess Georgie, because that’s the correct answer! ‘Divorce Day’ is the first Monday of the year. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with **stay-at-home mum**, a phrase for a woman who stays home to care for her children and manage the household.

**Georgie**\
If you **change your mind**, you change an earlier decision you made or opinion you had.

**Phil**\
If a problem is **unresolvable**, it cannot be satisfactorily solved or fixed.&#x20;

**Georgie**\
A **cooling-off period** is a period of time for two people to try to resolve their differences. It can also mean an agreed length of time in which someone can change their mind about something they’ve agreed to buy.

**Phil**\
To **intervene** means to become involved in a difficult situation in order to improve it.

**Georgie**\
And finally, the adverb **invariably** means always. Once again our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary. Goodbye for now!

**Phil**\
Bye!

#### 节目介绍

**菲尔** 大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 学英语的《6分钟英语》。我是菲尔。

**乔琪** 我是乔琪。

**菲尔** 正如上世纪60年代一首著名流行歌曲所唱的：“分手很难。”离婚，即一对已婚夫妇决定分开，不再在一起生活，可能是人生中最艰难的经历之一。

**乔琪** 在1990年代，欧洲和美国的离婚率位居全球最高，几乎有一半的婚姻以离婚告终。但自那以后，这一趋势发生了逆转，西方国家的离婚率开始下降。然而，其他地区的离婚人数却在上升。

**菲尔** 在本期节目中，我们将听到关于不同国家如何讨论离婚的话题。当然，我们也会学到一些实用的新词汇。不过首先，我有一个问题要问乔琪。在英国，有一天被离婚律师和婚姻顾问称为“离婚日”，请问是哪一天？

a) 圣诞节？\
b) 新年后的第一个星期一？\
c) 仲夏节（6月24日）？

**乔琪** 嗯，我认为“离婚日”是新年后的第一个星期一。

**菲尔** 好的，乔琪。稍后我们会揭晓正确答案。过早结婚，以及夫妻背景或兴趣的不同，是导致夫妻关系渐行渐远的常见原因之一。今天，我们将听到来自不列颠哥伦比亚大学研究性别经济学和人际关系的教授 Marina Adshade 的故事。她在 BBC 世界服务的节目《全球故事》中讲述了自己的经历：

#### Marina 的故事

**Marina Adshade** 我结婚很早，没有接受过教育。我嫁给了一个比我年长且受过高等教育的人。我们的婚姻起初还算顺利。但到了我二十多岁时，我决定回到学校，不再想做家庭主妇，这改变了我们的生活状况，最终变得无法解决。我认为很多婚姻都是这样，因为人们的生活情况会随着时间而改变，可能起初想要孩子，但后来又改变了主意。

**乔琪** Marina 起初是家庭主妇，即留在家中照顾孩子并打理家务的女性。

**菲尔** Marina 嫁给了一位年长的男性，尽管他们的关系一开始不错，但随着时间推移，他们对生活的期望逐渐产生了分歧。她和丈夫改变了最初的决定，也就是“改变了主意”。

**乔琪** 感情渐行渐远是离婚最常见的原因之一，最终 Marina 和她丈夫的问题变得无法解决，也就是“无法被修复或满意地解决”。她的经历对那些身陷无法维持的婚姻中的人来说非常典型。但遗憾的是，出于经济或情感原因，很多人仍然被困在这样的婚姻中。

#### 政府干预的讨论

**菲尔** 那么，有什么解决办法呢？现在，一些国家开始依赖官方的干预，而不是仅靠夫妻双方自行解决。BBC 世界服务的节目主持人 Lucy Hockings 和离婚顾问 Joanna Gosling 讨论了中国正在采取的新策略：

**Lucy Hockings** 中国引入了一个有趣的措施，即“冷静期”。这是由政府强制推行的。政府在这种情况下介入并要求人们冷静下来，这种做法有效吗？

**Joanna Gosling** 如果两人之间的关系动态没有变化，要求他们冷静下来并等一段时间，我认为并不会让他们突然意识到自己还想在一起。或许政府可以考虑为这些夫妻投资沟通培训项目，因为沟通不畅几乎总是导致感情破裂的原因。

**乔琪** 为了应对不断上升的离婚率，中国政府在2021年引入了30天的“冷静期”，即双方可以在这一时间段内尝试改善关系后再决定是否继续离婚。然而，政府干预私人生活是比较少见的做法。

**菲尔** Joanna 对“冷静期”是否有效表示怀疑，尤其是因为导致关系破裂的主要原因是不沟通。她说，缺乏沟通几乎总是离婚的原因。但积极的一面是，通过开放沟通，或在婚姻顾问的专业帮助下，挽救婚姻是有可能的。

#### 结尾与词汇总结

**乔琪** 我觉得是时候揭晓你的问题答案了，菲尔。你问我英国的“离婚日”是哪一天，我猜是新年后的第一个星期一。

**菲尔** 猜得不错，乔琪，因为这是正确答案！“离婚日”就是新年后的第一个星期一。好了，让我们回顾一下本期节目学到的词汇，首先是“家庭主妇”，指的是留在家里照顾孩子和管理家务的女性。

**乔琪** “改变主意”指的是改变自己之前的决定或看法。

**菲尔** 如果一个问题是“无法解决的”，就意味着它无法被满意地解决或修复。

**乔琪** “冷静期”指的是双方在做出进一步决定之前，尝试解决分歧的一段时间。这也可以指某人在同意购买某物后，有一段时间可以改变主意。

**菲尔** “干预”指的是为了改善困难局面而主动介入。

**乔琪** 最后，“invariably”这个副词意味着“总是”。

再次提醒，六分钟又结束了，别忘了下次继续收听我们的节目，了解更多热门话题和实用词汇。现在说再见吧！

**菲尔** 再见！
